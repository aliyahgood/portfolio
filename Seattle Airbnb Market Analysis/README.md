## Insights and Recommendations
- Equitable resource allocation
  - Increase funding for shelters in high-need counties, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego, where service demand is consistently high
  - Focus additional resources on high demand demographics, such as youth or seniors based on county distribution
- Targeted outreach
  - Implement targeted programs for growing demographics, like Hispanic/Latinx communities and youth, focusing specifically on counties where these groups are underrepresented or experiencing an increase in homelessness
