# Hi, I'm Aliyah - Aspiring Data Analyst

I'm a recent graduate in Economics with a minor in Computer Science, bringing a strong foundation in statistics, data analysis, and programming. I have hands-on experience in inventory management, vendor coordination, POS data analysis, and scheduling optimization, which I've applied to improve operational efficiency and support team performance. I'm now seeking opportunities to leverage both my technical and operational background in data or supply chain analyst roles.
